<p>The Threshold: What was the specific moment this quarter where "code" clicked for you? <br>

The Pit: What was the hardest assignment? How did you get yourself out of the "pit of despair"?<br>

The Pivot: Look at your original "Moodz and Vibes." How does your final portfolio compare? Did you stick to the plan or pivot? Why?<br>

The Process: What would you change about how you approached this course? (e.g., time management, reading documentation, asking for help).<br>

The Future: How do you see this hybrid skillset (Design + Code) impacting your future practice?<br>

1. <br>
I think the first moment that coding clicked for me was when we made our first index page. When I decided to add Linus Sebastian to my index page I realized 
that I have acquired a new power (making stupid websites). So things clicked pretty early on.<br>

The hardest assignment was definitely the field guide. It really made me realize that I was not committing some of the elements to memory, and I had a very
surface level of knowledge. I had to constantly refer to flex box guides, and I really didn't understand how a lot of the mobile code worked. I still would
have trouble trying to recreate the hamburger from scratch. I got myself out by just keeping with it and heavily relying on my therapist and my medications 
to keep my brain functioning. <br>

I pretty much just threw on colors and some styles I liked when I first created it. I definitely remade a lot of it for the Figma assignments. 
I didn't change much for this one, but I changed some colors and designs to make my final portfolio. I don't really have a full understanding of
what my personal mood/style would be, so I imagine that it will be changing a lot over time. <br>

 I would definitely take better notes, because I never was a good note taker, and its a miracle I have gotten this far. I definitely need to 
manage my time better, because even now I am writing this the night before it is due because I thought I could crank this out relatively fast. (I couldn't).
I also would ask more questions and try  to be as specific as possible when asking them so I can really learn instead of sorta understand for an hour and need
to look it up later. <br>

5. <br>
I am hoping that this skill set will give me a platform to make money to live comfortably because that has been my goal ever since teachers and other adult 
figures would ask "what are your goals?" I see this as hopefully a good gateway into a solid and stable career path. My goal is to develop these skills into 
something useful. <br>
