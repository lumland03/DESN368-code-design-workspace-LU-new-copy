            <h2> What is a Gnorp? </h2>
            <div class="pcon">
            <p> You might be wondering (who are we kidding I know you're wondering) what the heck a Gnorp is. Gnorps are tiny lil guys who like to do what everyone likes to do. Take naps, walk the dog, abolish tyrannical governments, everything! They are usually white and are about a half inch in size. Their colonies can range from just a few to enough to conquer whoever they please. Thankfully the only thing they like to conquer are rocks.

            <h2> What Do Gnorps Do?</h2>
            <div class="pcon">
            <p> Gnorps are usually pretty passive lil guys, and do not pose a threat to anyone! Unless you're The Thing from Marvel then probably be careful. They love nothing more than attacking rocks to claim the shards they drop. They collect shards and when they have enough they use it to construct their own buildings to more efficiently destroy the rock to get more shards. Gnorps usually form 3ish groups: the ones who like to hit the rock, the ones that like to collect the shards, and the ones who figure out how to use the shards to benefit their society.

            <h2> To Care for a Gnorp</h2>
            <div class="pcon">
            <p>  Honestly it's pretty hard to screw up Gnorp care. Make sure they have a rock to hit and they'll take care of the rest. After a while they'll outgrow the rocks you provide them, so make sure you're not just throwing them some garden pepples. Give them a nice heavy rock and maybe even a boulder sometimes. Some people think that they can adopt a while Gnorp, but in reality the Gnorp is just using you to search for rocks, and will disappear the moment they find one to bring the rest of their colony. The wild ones know what they are doing and you will be a victim. But aside from that all they really need is a durable rock so they don't get bored and make sure you replace it once they inevitably destroy it.

            <h2>Summarizing Gnorps</h2>
            <div class="pcon">
            <p> In summary, these are a very wacky group of goobers, who you should treat with respect. They'll treat you the way you treat them. Watch your back. As long as you care for them and give them fresh rocks when they run dry, you'll have a lifelong friendship with your own colony of Gnorps. Until they outgrow the rocks you provide them. Then it's best to make sure they don't think you're next.
