                <h2>Why Use a Reset</h2>
                    <p>
                        The initial problem that CSS resets solved was that no 2 browsers had the same CSS defaults. 
                        This made it very difficult to create a webpage that looked identical between multiple browsers.
                        There were tiny differences in each browser, such as slightly different margins or padding, text that was underlined or italicized, etc. 
                        Having a reset equalizes all of the differences on different browsers so that each browser is a blank page for the CSS rules to be applied to, making them the same across almost every browser.

                    <p>
                        Josh considers Eric's reset to be outdated, and needed modernized. The main issue that resetting fixed
                        isn't all that common or egregious in modern browsers. Josh's also was more suited for 
                        differnt styles and aesthetics and was unopinionated with its reset.

                <h2>How Are They Used</h2>
                <p>
                    Resets and Normalize are both used by linking them as stylesheets. Similar to a normal CSS stylesheet. 
                    They are applied before the styles file to take priority for the reset or the normalization of the browsers
                    imbedded defaults.

                <h2>What is a CSS Boilerplate</h2>
                <p>
                    A CSS boiler plate is similar to a reset or normalize, but it isn't a separate file. The boilerplate
                    is placed at the top of your main stylesheet and sets a base ruleset/setting for the rest of the file, such as 
                    using "*" to select all elements and set the margins and padding to 0.

                <h2>Why Use a Boilerplate</h2>
                <p>
                    Boilerplates are great at saving time, and unifying elements across pages. They are easy to paste into a CSS file
                    to set the base rules for the page, so you don't have to individually change them every time you make a new page. 
                    They also help keep your rules consistent between pages you create for a site.

            <section id="q-6">
                <h2>How is Normalize Different Than Reset</h2>
                <p>
                    Normalize is different than reset because instead of resetting every default browser element, it only
                    affects some, and leaves some defaults. This way, the page is uniform, but it also saves a bit of time 
                    by keeping some default rules you plan on using. Reset completely starts you from a blank slate, while 
                    normalize is like a preset to work from.

            Reset  Reasoning <br>

                All browsers have defaults but none share the exact same
                The initial problem that CSS resets solved was that no 2 browsers had the same CSS defaults. 
                This made it very difficult to create a webpage that looked identical between multiple browsers.
                There were tiny differences in each browser, such as slightly different margins or padding, text that was underlined or italicized, etc. 
                Having a reset equalizes all of the differences on different browsers so that each browser is a blank page for the CSS rules to be applied to, making them the same across almost every browser. 

                Internet Explorer back in the day was a large example of this, as it didn't even recognize a lot of CSS rules. 
                This made IE annoying to work with, so people started to work with other browsers such as Firefox or Safari. 

                There are dozens of small changes and adjustments between them

                His one is unopinionized and can be used for any style or aesthetic </p>

                Josh's model 

                In modern days, browsers are better at taking CSS rules and applying them faithfully. Resets aren't as important as browsers aren't as egregious.
                HE believes that some default stuylings are nice to have 
                Josh liked to apply defaults for all (*) elements, such as margin 0

                using interpolate size properties you can do small animations without JS (only on CHrome/Edge)
                Transform: scale is usually better if available 


                A CSS boilerplate is unlike a reset because it just sets the main page to have a uniform format rather than resetting every element to 0.\
                normalize.css is different than a reset, because it doesn't strip all defaults away, rather it keeps the useful ones, and provides some uniform settings aswell.

                CSS boilerplates help save time and help with efficiency by setting a blank canvas to work with, so you don't have to manually enter in basic rules or changes. They are also lightweight and ensure consistent 
                elements. 

                For resets and normalize you link a file |rel stylesheet href name| before your styles file.
