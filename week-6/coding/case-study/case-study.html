            <h2>Design Decisions: What design choices did you make and why?</h2>
            <p> I wanted to stray away from my usual blue designs that I enjoy making. So I went for a brighter red color that 
                I feel resonates the colors from the game. I used a pallet generator for the rest of the colors to help with
                creating a good pallet with good contrast. </p>
            <p>
                The type for headings that I used are similar to the pixilated graphics of the game. They aren't perfectly
                pixelated because I felt that it would be more pleasant to use. The second type I chose for no particular reason.
                It was a pleasant font, and I felt it worked well with the main font. </p>
            <p>
                The main design was created off the top of my head. I just took inspiration with the example I saw and created something 
                similar. I added some bits that I liked and didn't add things that I thought would be too difficult. I liked the right hand side
                for the mobile nav menu icon. I also preferred a nav that dropped from the y axis and not from the x. <br>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="content" id="question-2">
            <h2>Technical Challenges: What was difficult to code? How did you solve it? </h2>
            <p>The most difficult thing in general was trying to further my understanding of flexboxes and the nav bar. 
                I really struggled with trying to understand what affected what, and why somethings didn't do what I wanted them to do.
                Figuring it out was a lot of trial and error, patience, and increasing my ADHD medication. </p>
            <p>
                Another thing I struggled with was the mobile designs. I copied a lot of the code from a tutorial and adjusting it as necessary.
                For the most part, its original code. I don't want to use code that I struggle to understand because I feel I won't learn 
                that way. It was a lot more trial and error to figure things out in a way I (mostly) understood. 
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="content" id="question-3">
            <h2>Responsive Strategy: How did you adapt your design for mobile?</h2>
            <p>Like the previous question, a good bit of the code was added from a tutorial that took care of a decent amount of the work.
                A lot of the adapting that I did was using percentages to adjust sizes that are consistent between mobile and desktop.
                Between that and adjusting min and max widths it took care of a lot of the work swapping between desktop and mobile. </p>
            <p>
                The mobile navbar was something I really struggled with. I had to figure out what to change from existing code to add what I 
                wanted and to change what I didn't. I pretty much got the effect I wanted, but it was in a decently janky way. Trying to match 
                up the titles from the top to the navbar drop down was a pain I want to avoid for a while.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="content" id="question-4">
            <h2>Learning Moments: What did you learn about Flexbox or CSS positioning? </h2>
            <p>Most of what I have learned from Flexbox and positioning was just reinforcing what I have been practicing. I think I understand
                more about flexbox than I do the positioning. I wasn't able to tell between the differences when I was throwing code in
                trying to see what different lines did. </p>
            <p>
                I still don't entirely understand the relationships between different coding things, such as max/min width, margins
                and flexbox placements. I think I need to study more of the relationships between different lines to understand how to use
                different lines together to accurately create something that I want to.  
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="content" id="question-5">
            <h2>Future Improvements: What would you add or change with more time? </h2>
            <p>The main thing that I would want to change would probably be adding more content and making it be more indepth. I would have to 
                research different designs to see what I would like to try adding or changing. Maybe adding more pictures across the main content 
                as you scroll to give a cool graphic effect. </p>
            <p> 
                I would also like to have more efficent code, and learn to not be redudant with what I try to add or change.
                A lot of my issues I feel is being very inefficent or having janky code that technically works, but isn't pretty. 
                I would rather have really clean code and not know as much, than know a lot and give anyone who looks like it a migraine trying to decipher it.
