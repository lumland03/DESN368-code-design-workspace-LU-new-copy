Project Description: 
    A product landing page created for the game Satisfactory, by Coffee Stain Studios. 

Css Transformation:
    The images on the carousel have a fade in/out animation when switching between images. 

Css Animation:
    Unless there is also one snuck into the carousel I do not believe I implemented one.

Table Content Type:
    The content in my 2 tables are the features of the game, and the required specs for a PC to adequately run Satisfactory. 

Challenges:
    The greatest challenge I had was stretching myself too thin between classes. I know I am missing several required elements, and that is due to not having enough time to add them, and wanting to move on to the next assignment so I dont get myself even farther behind. 
    The biggest coding challenge would definitely be trying to create the image carousel, which I had to follow a tutorial for, and used CSS and JS and I didn't have the time (or patience) to understand the code I was copying. That and trying to implement required elements as fast as I could without it being extremely sloppy (some of it is). 

Key Learnings: 
    I definitely learned that I need to give myself adequate time between classes to complete work. Coding wise I definitely am more used to creating nav links and mobile settings, and am getting the hang of grids, tables, and somewhat forms. I hope to expand on these further. 

Final notes: 
    Despite missing some required elements, I am still proud of the site I built, and I think overall its the best thing I have created thus far in class. I can allow myself to be proud despite knowing that my excitement for my site will not have a matching grade due to the missing requirements, and sloppy last minute additions to try to fill some.
