    <p class="story">A mile, maybe, from Parth Galen in a little glade not far from the
lake he found Boromir. He was sitting with his back to a great tree,
as if he was resting. But Aragorn saw that he was pierced with many
black-feathered arrows; his sword was still in his hand, but it was
broken near the hilt; his horn cloven in two was at his side. Many
Orcs lay slain, piled all about him and at his feet.
<p class="story">
  Aragorn knelt beside him. Boromir opened his eyes and strove to
speak. At last slow words came. ‘I tried to take the Ring from Frodo,’ he
said. ‘I am sorry. I have paid.’ His glance strayed to his fallen enemies;
twenty at least lay there. ‘They have gone: the Halflings: the Orcs have
taken them. I think they are not dead. Orcs bound them.’ He paused
and his eyes closed wearily. After a moment he spoke again.
  </p>
<p class="story">
‘Farewell, Aragorn! Go to Minas Tirith and save my people! I
  have failed.’ </p>
<p class="story">
  ‘No!’ said Aragorn, taking his hand and kissing his brow. ‘You
have conquered. Few have gained such a victory. Be at peace! Minas
Tirith shall not fall!’
Boromir smiled. 
  </p>
<p class="story"> ‘Which way did they go? Was Frodo there?’ said Aragorn. But Boromir did not speak again. </p>
  <h2 id="two"> Explanations </h2>
  <p class="questions"> I chose the book because I feel it has a very distinct fantasy look that would be iconic and probably challenge to replicate. This led me to chosing both the Quintessential font, and the Nova Round fonts. The first one I feel is a really good font that exudes the same fantasy vibe as the movies and book fonts. So much so that I had to double check that it wasnt a varient of the fonts they use for the official books. The Nova Round font isn't as spot on as the Quintessential font, but I feel it also recreates the feel of the books while being readable and toned down.</p>
