  <h2> About This Recipe</h2>
  <p> Searing the beef pieces before you add the stock makes such a difference in the flavor you get from the soup.<br> Its really the only chance you have to get that delicious caramelization on the meat!<br>

As the veggies and broth simmer, you will really start to notice the flavors in the stew intensify.<br> Peas cook quickly so I add them in the last few minutes! <br>

This stew recipe is also the perfect way to use up any vegetables you might need to use up. <br>If youve got leftover roasted potatoes, glazed carrots or fried mushrooms, just chop em up up and throw them in! <br> </p>
  <h2> Ingredients </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 pounds stewing beef trimmed and cubed</li>

  <ol>

    <li> Add the onions to the pot, adding more oil as needed, and cook until they begin to soften, about <b>3 minutes</b>. </li>
    <li>Add beef broth and red wine while scraping up any brown bits in the pan.</li>

    <li> Mix equal parts cornstarch and water to create a slurry. Slowly add the slurry to the boiling stew to reach desired consistency <br> (you may not need all of the slurry, if you'd like a thicker stew, you can add extra). </li>
