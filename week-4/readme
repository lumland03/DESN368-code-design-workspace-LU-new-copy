## Reflection

**What was the hardest part of translating your design to code?**
The hardest part was trying to get the blue banner at the top of the screen to be slightly below the image, and then in class i learned it had the easiest solution.

**What CSS property/concept do you feel you understand better now?**
I definitely understand the boxes better and I understand how to make layouts generally.

**How closely does your code match your design? What would you do differently?**
My site is pretty exact to the figma design. I am really happy with how I transfered it all to be on the actual site. I want to make it universal for phones and different browsers.
